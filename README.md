# Introduction

This is a [portfolio website](https://shrivastavaakash.github.io/) and [Blog](https://shrivastavaakash.github.io/blogs) project.

This project was created with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.3, with Bootstrap for UI styling.

For writing blogs, I've added [ngx-markdown](https://github.com/jfcere/ngx-markdown/) to parse markdown docs into HTML.

Head over to the [Blog](https://shrivastavaakash.github.io/blogs), where I have written some posts that discuss the setup process for it in details.

Some posts that discuss the setup:

1. [My First Blog](http://shrivastavaakash.github.io/blog/my-first-blog)
2. [Problems with an SPA site for blogs](http://shrivastavaakash.github.io/blog/spa-for-blogs)
3. [Pre-render static SPA without a live back-end](http://shrivastavaakash.github.io/blog/prerender-on-build)
